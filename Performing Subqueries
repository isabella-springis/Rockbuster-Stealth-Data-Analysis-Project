** Step 1: Find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers. **


-- Outer Query:

SELECT AVG(sum) AS Average
FROM (SELECT C.first_name, C.last_name, sum(amount)

-- Inner Query:
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id = B.rental_id
INNER JOIN customer C ON B.customer_id = C.customer_id
INNER JOIN address D ON C.address_id = D.address_id
INNER JOIN city E ON D.city_id = E.city_id
INNER JOIN country F ON E.country_id = F.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Atlixco','Zalantun','Pontianak','Tarsus','Aparecida de
Goinia','Emeishan','Rio Claro','Yingkou','Tokat')
GROUP BY first_name, last_name
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid

** Step 2: Find out how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country. **


SELECT D.country,
COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customer.customer_id) AS "top customer count"
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON E.customer_id = A.customer_id
LEFT JOIN (SELECT A.customer_id,A.first_name, A.last_name,country,city,
SUM(amount) as
total_amount_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
INNER JOIN payment E ON E.customer_id = A.customer_id
WHERE city IN
('Aurora','Tokat','Tarsus','Atlixco','Emeishan','Pontianak','Shimoga','Aparecida de
Goinia','Zalantun','Taguig')
GROUP BY A.customer_id,A.first_name, A.last_name,country,city
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5 ) AS top_5_customer

ON D.country = top_5_customer.country

GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY COUNT(D.country) DESC
LIMIT 10;
