# Rockbuster-Stealth-Data-Analysis-Project
You’ve been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI) department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries. Your first task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.

Answered a series of business questions from The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board and provided data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company campaign.

Questions:
1.	Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain? 
2.	What was the average rental duration for all videos?
3.	Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
4.	Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
5.	Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?


How: 
* Query the data using SQL.
* Visualize the data in an easy-to-consume manner.
