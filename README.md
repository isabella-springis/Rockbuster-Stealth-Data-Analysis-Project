### Conclusion

We recommend that RockBuster Stealth redirect their efforts towards gaining revenue, in order to launch a successful online video rental service. To do so, we have suggested various strategies that will expand the customer base, as well as reward loyal customers. These include:

 * Monitor customer activity (eg film genre, streaming times) in order to promote relevant content.
 * Implement a 'refer a friend' rewards system in regions with a smaller customer base in order to expand.
 * Implement promotions that reward customers for viewing/spending more.
